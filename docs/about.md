I am a PhD student with Boston University's Faculty of Computing and Data Science. My research interests are primarily based around trying to understand complex systems to learn more about how to deal with issues such as societal equity, disaster response, climate change, etc. So far I have used modeling and simulation as my tools to tackle this research.

Outside of work, my greatests joys and my family, my cat (Morrigan), and food (both eating and cooking). Please let me know if you have any good restaurant or recipe recommendations. I also enjoy riding and fixing bikes, racquetball, and starting (but often not finishing) various electronics or home improvement projects.
