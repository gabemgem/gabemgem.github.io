## Education
B.S. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. Completed in May 2020.

## The MITRE Corporation --- Software Engineer --- 2020-2022
At MITRE I worked on a large variety of projects as a software engineer in both junior developer and leadership roles. Some of the projects I worked on include the following.

### Artificial Societies
- Developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulating Washington DC to examine the opiod crisis
- Expanded a framework used for the quick development of generic artificial societies
- Rebuilt the model in Python to look at wildfire insurance
- Engaged in weekly meetings with subject matter experts
- Worked with Repast HPC, Repast4Py, C++, Python, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, Apache Druid, and Apache Superset

### The Artificial Organization
- Developed an ABM simulating COVID-19 spread through a university
- Set up scenarios and performed data-analysis on the results
- Collaborated with several external organizations and universities
- Worked with Java and Simudyne (an ABM SDK) for development, and with Python and Excel for analysis

### The Agnostic Simulation Framework
- Developed a messaging framework for large-scale distributed simulations on top of RTI DDS
- Developed time management libraries on top of the framework for time-stepped simulations
- Developed an initial multi-level-security implementation for the framework
- Built automated testing tools for the framework
- Engaged in discussions and ontology development for complex simulations

### Tempo Gain
- Developed a data visualization website
- Specialized in a network graph workspace
- Worked with Vue, D3.js, and Javascript

### MITRE Engineering Platform
- Developed a backend REST API for a knowledge management platform
- Facilitated a transfer of the knowledge database from Anzo to CKAN
- Managed several software engineering interns
- Worked with Nest.js and Typescript


## Onshape Inc. --- Software Development Intern --- 2019
At Onshape I developed and released code for a cloud-based CAD app. I worked on both server-side (Java) and client-side (Typescript) code. I also learned how to navigate a large and unfamiliar codebase.

## Computer Science and Engineering REU at Washington University in St. Louis --- Research Intern --- 2018
At Wash U I worked on a research project involving parsing big data on GPUs using parallel processing. I worked with OpenCL and CUDA to program the GPUs. We were able to find efficient solutions for irregular streaming applications on SIMD hardware.

## Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach --- Research Intern --- 2017
At Tufts, I developed a communication interface between LEGO WeDo 2.0 devices and LabVIEW to make Internet of Things (IoT) devices in classrooms. I also worked with a variety of devices, such as the National Instruments myRIO, Raspberry Pi, and Particle Photon, to study their IoT potential.
